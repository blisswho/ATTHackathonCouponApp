# CouponMe
CouponMe won 3rd Place for Best Overall Entertainment App @ 2018 NYC AT&amp;T Entertainment Hackathon. CouponMe scans brand names on coupons using Google Vision SDK to display stores in your local area where your coupon can be cashed in.

## How it works
CouponMe uses Google Maps, Google Places, and Google Vision SDKs for Android in order to scan for brands and return all stores in your local area that your are available to cash in your coupon. It brings up results using a combination of Google Places search results and hard-coded values due to the inefficency of the free version for Google Places. In the future, we hope to invest capital into a more accurate geo-location search engine and return more results.
